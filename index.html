            stack. In that scenario, current valuation offers reasonable upside over a 3–5 year horizon, but
            volatility is expected to remain high.

              <p>
                Oddity Tech Ltd. is a consumer tech platform building digital first beauty and wellness brands powered
                by AI, data science, and computer vision. Its core franchises — IL MAKIAGE and SpoiledChild —
                are scaled almost entirely through direct to consumer channels, supported by proprietary recommendation
                engines and, increasingly, by ODDITY Labs, a molecule discovery platform that adapts pharma like
                R&amp;D tools to beauty and wellness.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company is executing on a playbook that blends software style data feedback loops with the
                unit economics of prestige beauty. Q3 2025 results reinforce this narrative: revenue grew 24% YoY to
                $148M, gross margin expanded to 71.6%, adjusted EBITDA reached $29M, and free cash flow for the
                first nine months of 2025 was about $90M. Management raised its full year outlook to ~$806–809M in
                revenue, ~72.5% gross margin, and adjusted EPS of $2.10–2.12.
              </p>
              <p>
                At roughly 20x current year earnings for a business growing revenue in the mid 20s %, with
                high returns on equity and strong cash generation, Oddity screens as a high quality growth
                compounder. However, investor risk appetite is constrained by the short public history, heavy reliance
                on a small number of brands, and the inherently competitive, marketing intensive nature of beauty and
                wellness.

              <p><strong>1. Business Model — Strong (5/5)</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Digital first, direct to consumer model with no legacy retail footprint, enabling full ownership of customer data and higher margins.</li>
                <li>Revenue primarily from beauty and wellness products sold under IL MAKIAGE and SpoiledChild, with recurring purchase patterns and subscription like behavior in several SKUs.</li>
                <li>Unified data and technology stack powering acquisition, conversion, and cross sell across brands, effectively creating a shared platform with attractive scalability.</li>
                <li>Asset light structure with limited physical assets relative to revenue, allowing rapid iteration and brand launches on top of the same infrastructure.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>2. Management — Strong (4/5)</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Founding team and leadership with deep experience in digital marketing, data science, and beauty branding.</li>
                <li>Execution track record: scaled IL MAKIAGE to hundreds of millions in revenue, launched SpoiledChild successfully, and consistently beat guidance since listing.</li>
                <li>Communication is direct and data driven; guidance and delivery have so far been aligned, which supports credibility.</li>
                <li>Public company history is still short; governance and capital allocation behavior across cycles remain to be tested.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>3. Moat — Strong (4/5)</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Data advantage: large and growing database of consumer behavior, skin profiles, preferences, and product performance.</li>
                <li>Proprietary algorithms and machine learning models match consumers to specific products and shades, improving conversion and retention.</li>
                <li>ODDITY Labs adds a second moat layer via proprietary molecule discovery and IP, differentiating product efficacy beyond branding alone.</li>
                <li>However, beauty remains a brand driven, competitive market; switching costs are real but not insurmountable, and competitors can copy elements of the go to market playbook.</li>
              </ul>
